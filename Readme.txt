The package includes
1.	Model Document
2.	Submission and personal information
3.	extractData.c can read specific messages from data.txt and write them into MoreSimple.db.
4.	analysisData.c can read designed messages from MoreSimple.db and store them into dataTotal arrays. This file can generate the final results after compiled.
5.	This package does not conclude data.txt, because it is too big. If you want to compile extractData.c, data.txt should be copied here.
